This document contains the instructions for preparing a manuscript for the proceedings of ACL-IJCNLP 2021.
The document itself conforms to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of what your manuscript should look like.
These instructions should be used for both papers submitted for review and for final versions of accepted papers.
Authors are asked to conform to all the directions reported in this document.

\subsection{Title and Authors}
\label{ssec:title-authors}

Center the title, author's name(s) and affiliation(s) across both columns.
Do not use footnotes for affiliations.
Place the title centered at the top of the first page, in a 15-point bold font.
Long titles should be typed on two lines without a blank line intervening.
Put the title 2.5 cm from the top of the page, followed by a blank line, then the author's names(s), and the affiliation on the following line.
Do not use only initials for given names (middle initials are allowed).
Do not format surnames in all capitals (\emph{e.g.}, use ``Mitchell'' not ``MITCHELL'').
Do not format title and section headings in all capitals except for proper names (such as ``BLEU'') that are
conventionally in all capitals.
The affiliation should contain the author's complete address, and if possible, an electronic mail address.

The title, author names and addresses should be completely identical to those entered to the electronical paper submission website in order to maintain the consistency of author information among all publications of the conference.
If they are different, the publication chairs may resolve the difference without consulting with you; so it is in your own interest to double-check that the information is consistent.

Start the body of the first page 7.5 cm from the top of the page.
\textbf{Even in the anonymous version of the paper, you should maintain space for names and addresses so that they will fit in the final (accepted) version.}


\subsection{References}

\section*{Acknowledgments}

The acknowledgments should go immediately before the references. Do not number the acknowledgments section.
\textbf{Do not include this section when submitting your paper for review.}
